 In this study, we 
developed a model to predict cardiovascular disease to reduce deaths from cardiovascular 
disease.in this paper, we introduced a k-type clustering method that can improve classification 
accuracy. 
Machine learning methods Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) classifier, 
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and XG Boost (XGB) are utilized by GridSearchCV.
It is used to tune parameters to improve results. The proposed model was implemented on a 
real dataset consisting of 70,000 samples obtained from Kaggle. Data was split in 80:20 ratio 
and got the following accuracy: Decision Tree:82.69% (with cross-validation) and 
83.93%(without cross-validation), XGBoost:83.31%(with cross-validation) and 
84.46%(without cross-validation), Random Forest:84.47%(with cross-validation) and 
84.13(without cross-validation), Multilayer Perceptron:84.23%(with cross-validation) and 
84.19(without cross-validation). The results of this simple study in that the cross-validated 
random forest outperforms all other algorithms in accuracy. The highest accuracy reaches 
84.47%.
